    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Source: http://greenwood.cr.usgs.gov/pub/quad-indexes. Then NRCS-ITC converted to Lon/Lat NAD83. Forced all coordinates to nearest even increment of 7.5 minutes to remove precision problems from being re-projected. Updated quad name, add quad date field, add missing quads. Generate FIPS_C field of inside, crossing, touching counties.

Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Attributes in the index maps identify the file and quad names, quad scales, quad dates and locational FIPS code.  Geographic coordinates for the bottom, top, left and right sides of each quad are provided as well.
    Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation: Relevant attributes are:  QUADID - USGS latitude/longitude file name, QUADNAME - quad name, QUADDATE - date that appears on the paper quad,  CREDATE - USGS DRG production date, SOURCE-USGS source material date, North/South/East/West - Minimum bounding rectangle coordinates, FIPS_C - state and county 5-digit FIPS codes for the quad
